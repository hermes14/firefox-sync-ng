== INFO ==
firefox-sync-ng is a simple script to synchronize the firefox profile residing
in a physical directory (usually ~/.firefox/) with a copy in /dev/shm using
tmpfs, to speed the browsing up and limit disk writes, that is especially
useful with SSDs.

== INSTALLATION ==
Just copy syncfox into a directory included in your $PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin
or ~/bin).

== USAGE ==
Type
  $ firefox-sync-ng -h
for help on usage.
